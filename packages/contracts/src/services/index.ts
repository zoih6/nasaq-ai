/**
 * U2 Service bounded context — public surface.
 *
 * This module owns every U2 session/run/stage/event/receipt/handoff type. It is
 * intentionally separate from the prototype Agent/Flow shapes exported by
 * `@nasaq/contracts`: `ServiceRun` is not `AgentRun` or `FlowRun`, and
 * `SimulationReceipt` is not an `ExecutionReceipt`.
 *
 * Ownership rules (mandatory addendum section 4):
 * - contract shapes are Zod-first and carry a `Service*` name or a service
 *   namespace;
 * - nothing here may be promoted to a canonical Backend schema;
 * - product-agent Backend/Runtime remains NO-GO and not implemented.
